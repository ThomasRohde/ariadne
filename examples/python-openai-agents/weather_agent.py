"""
Weather Agent Example with Ariadne Tracing

Demonstrates OpenAI Agents SDK integration with Ariadne real-time trace viewer.
This example showcases comprehensive tracing patterns including:
- Higher-level trace wrapping for workflows
- Custom spans for operations
- Metadata and group IDs
- Error handling with tracing
- RunConfig customization
